          <p> <strong>Mackenzie Coyne</strong> passed away 2 days after her 8th birthday. She was the happiest little girl. She loved life. She loved her family- especially her older sister, Madison and her younger brother, Mason. She loved her friends- both in Overland Park, Kansas and in Park City, Utah.

            <p>She loved gymnastics and soccer. She had just learned how to ski and how to ice skate which both became favorite things, too. She loved playing outside- sledding and playing in the snow in the winter and riding her bike and swimming in the summer.

              <p>She was a little girl with the kindest heart. She was the kid that would be nice to the kids that everyone else ignored. She prayed for others- even the boy in her class who broke his leg or her gymnastics teacher who hurt her foot.
